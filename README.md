# Prediction-of-Seattle-Building-Energy-Consumption
The project is for predicting energy consumption and GHG emission of non-residential buildings of the city of Seattle. For that purpose, multiple supervided learning technique were tested and the best technique is selected in terms of prediction time, error, and accuracy.

The project is divided into four sections:


The first and second points are covered in the notebook 'Exploration_notebook'.\
The third and fourth points are covered in the notebook 'Energy_prediction_notebook' for predicting the energy consumption and in the notebook 'GHG_prediction_notebook' for predicting the GHG emission of the buildings.\
A powerpoint presentation of the project can be shared under request.
